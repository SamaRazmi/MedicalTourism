				<h3>The surgical procedures performed in the eye area are: </h3>1- Cataract (Cataract)<br/>2-Corneal diseases<br/> 3. Glaucoma (black water)<br/> 4-laziness of the eye and luchnia (strabismus)<br/> 5. Eyelid and tear ducts<br/> 6. Retinal diseases<br/>7-Collagen Crossover Gain (CCL) for cornea<br/>8. Austin injection for retinal disease<br/>9. Cornea inside the cornea for the cornea (ICRS)<br/> Lumbar laxity (strabismus)<br/>
				<h2>1-Glasses</h2> Contact lenses<br/> Soft (soft) to modify proximity and cameras<br/> Hard to modify proximity, cameras and astigmatism<br/> Soft torque for correcting proximity, camera, and astigmatism - The lenses are similar to ordinary lenses and their differences in their shape and design. These lenses are more stable when blinking or tilting the eyes, and they are less likely to get out of the eye.
				<br/>
				<h2>2- Cataract (Cataract)</h2> In phacoemulsification (Phaco), a very small incision is made in the eye, then the patient's lens is broken down into smaller particles by ultrasound or laser radiation, and finally, the particles are removed by microsuction (suction tube). The posterior capsule remains in place to maintain the lens that is placed in the eye. The lens is a folding type and, after entering the capsule, the lens opens and adapts itself to its shape and size.<br/>
				<b>Lensectomy:</b> This method is used to correct extremely severe refractive errors (proximity and cameras). It is also used in congenital cataract and children Planting of intraocular clamshell lenses following Phaco and Phaco Laser Single focal lens (monofocal)<br/>
				<b>Multi-focal lenses:</b> Multi-focal lenses make the distance from the distant distance closer and closer to each other, thus reducing the dependence of people on glasses or contact lenses. There are currently two types of refractive and de-ractious lenses that each have their own advantages and disadvantages. If the use of Refractive lenses is good, the vision is moderate and the close vision is acceptable, but it may be difficult for a person to see the details. If you use Diffractive lenses, close vision (reading vision) is good and distant vision is good, but average visual disturbance may occur. For example, it may be necessary for a person to reduce his distance to the computer or reduce the size of the fonts As well as some people may see light halo around the light source at night. Accommodative lenses: The lens of the human eye naturally adapts to a clear, clear view, a process that gradually decreases with increasing age and lens elasticity. Adaptive lenses are also made from materials that try to match the natural lens of the human, although the matching created by these lenses is less than the human need.

				<h2>3. Corneal diseases</h2> Intacs + Artisan Torric Plant: Intacs is a device used to treat 1 to 3 diopters close to the anesthesia without astigmatism, which increases the integrity of the cornea and ultimately improves the cornea's cornea. This method is used in those who do not have contact lens tolerance, and up to 20% have improved vision and can use glasses. Hard lenses<br/>

				<h2>4. Glaucoma (black water)</h2> Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT): This method is used to treat open angle glaucoma. In this method, a wavelength is used that only affects the cells that contain melanin in the trabecular network. The initial biological response to this wavelength is in the order that releases cytokines (a kind of chemical mediators) and they also activate and accumulate macrophages (a kind of cell) and cause changes that ultimately lead to lower eye pressure it is possible. Because the wavelength used in this technique does not injure other tissues, it can be repeated several times throughout its life.
				<br/> Endoscopic Cyclophotocoagulation (ECP) Endoscopic Cyclophotocoagulation (ECP): This procedure, which is performed in the operating room, is used to treat the eyelids that cause the sebaceous fluid to secrete. This process reduces the secretion of alkaline fluid and ultimately reduces the pressure of the eye. This is common practice with cataract surgery.
				<br/> Surgical treatments to lower intraocular pressure
				<br/> Cataract and glaucoma combined surgery
				<br/> Trabeculectomy
				<br/>
				<b>Trabeculotomy:</b> This method is somewhat similar to trabecullectomy, in which a portion of the tissue of the discharge angle is removed, which causes the opening of the pore to open out more fluid. This method is usually used to treat congenital glaucoma when the cornea (the transparent part on the iris) is cloudy. For the treatment of children, this method or method of gonotomy is commonly used because the two methods are less invasive.
				<br/>
				<b>Goniotomy:</b> A surgical procedure in which the physician uses a special lens called goniolens to see the angle of the eye. A method used to treat congenital glaucoma when the cornea is not cloudy. In this method, a pore in the trabecular network (sets of fine ducts that are located at the angle of the drainage of the eye) is created that improves the drainage of the aqueous fluid. Providing eye shints, such as Ahmed Valve and Molteno, are metal or plastic tubes that are connected to one rectangular, round or elliptical plate, on one side. The shunt acts as an artificial discharging system and is placed in the eye through a small cut. The shunt drives the alkaline fluid into a region underneath the conjunctiva (a subtle layer that covers the inner part of the eyelids and the white eye of the eye). Ultrasonic fluid is finally absorbed through the blood vessels.
				<br/>
				<h2>5-Lumbar laxity (strabismus)</h2> Diagnosis and treatment of amblyopia in children<br/> Diagnosis and treatment of ocular deviations (congenital and acquired strabismus<br/> Diagnosis and treatment of refractive errors in children<br/> Diagnosis and treatment of other pediatric ophthalmic diseases.<br/>
				<h2>6- Plectic and duct diseases</h2> Diagnosis of congenital and acquired systemic diseases and their treatment<br/> Laser, non-laser and endoscopic lacrimal surgery, and the Smart plug: Smart plug is inserted into the lacrimal duct, then it is shorter and wider, and in the form of a lacrimal canal (tear outlet vent in the lower eyelid near the nose It comes in and no part of it is above the eyelid's surface and it can not be removed by rubbing the eyes. It takes only a few minutes to put it in the eye. This method is used in patients with severe eye drops and the use of artificial drops does not improve their symptoms. Eyelid surgery<br/> Eyelash Beauty Surgery<br/> Other beautiful surgeries, such as Negin Planting<br/>

				<h2>7. Retinal and Vitreous Diseases</h2> Diagnosis and treatment of diabetic retinopathy and its complications<br/> Diagnosis and treatment of retina wall pains (retina) and retinal holes<br/> Diagnosis and treatment of retinal vascular lesions<br/> Diagnosis and treatment of retinopathy in preterm infants<br/> Deep vitrectomy using the latest and non-stitched equipment<br/> Diagnosis and treatment of retinal detachments<br/> Diagnosis and treatment of hereditary diseases of the retina<br/> Diagnosis and treatment of vascular diseases of the retina<br/> Diagnosis and treatment of general diseases with retinal complications<br/> Diagnosis and treatment of eye rupture and its complications<br/> Diagnosis and treatment of retinal and subcutaneous hemorrhages<br/> Diagnosis and treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD)<br/> Identification and treatment of macular hole<br/> Diagnosis and treatment of macular edema<br/> Diagnosis and treatment of ocular complications caused by intraocular lens and its displacement<br/>
				<b>Treatment of keratoconus (keratoconus)</b> Crosslinking or Corneal Collagen crosslinking with Riboflavin: This procedure lasts about 1 hour. First, a drop of riboflavin is cast into the eye, and then this droplet is activated by ultraviolet radiation, and eventually increases collagen transection. It increases the strength of the cornea, resulting in stopping the keratoconus, and the eye score does not change much.
