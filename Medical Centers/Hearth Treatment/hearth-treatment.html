				<h4>Types of Heart Surgery Used by experienced and elite surgeons through modern equipment:</h4> Cardiac surgery has several different models, most commonly known as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or bypass surgery, also known as open heart surgery. We will continue to explore other cardiac surgery methods.
				<h4>open heart surgery:</h4> Coronary artery bypass surgery or open heart surgery involves the use of healthy parts of the blood vessels of parts of the body to bypass part of the coronary artery damaged or blocked . In open heart surgery, by creating a new pathway for blood flow, the heart muscle will achieve oxygen - rich blood that will be needed for proper activity .
				<br> During the bypass heart surgery, the chest (sternum) is opened, the heart stopped and blood is sent to the cardiopulmonary system. Unlike other types of open heart surgery, heart cavities do not open during the bypass surgery.<br> Bypass single, double bypass, bypassing triads or quadrants to the required number of arteries.<br>

				</center>
				<br>
				<h4>Valve repair or replacement:</h4> The heart valves play a key role in this one-way blood flow and open and close with each heartbeat. The pressure changes in the back and in front of the valve allow them to open the flap, such as a one-way valve and only at the right time, and then close them firmly to prevent the return flow.
				<center><img src="images/Heart-valve-repair.jpg" style="height:200px;width:50%;"/>
				</center>
				Two of the most common types of heart valve problems that require heart surgery:
				<h5>1. Stenosis of the heart valve:</h5> In the stenosis of the mitral valve, the jaws do not open sufficiently enough, and only a small amount of blood can flow through the valve. Stenosis (stenosis) occurs when the beard is thick, stiff or mixed. Valve surgery is done to open the tight valve or replace it with one of the new valves.<br>
				<h5>2-Heart valve failure:</h5> Failure of the heart valve means insufficient or inadequate cardiac valve, in this case the valve does not properly close to the front rather than move properly and the blood leaks back. Heart valve surgery is required for stenosis or valve replacement.<br><br> Heart valve repair and surgery include rehabilitation of the valve to re-operate properly. Replacing the valve means that the valve is replaced by a biological heart valve (made from animals or tissues of the human body) or a mechanical valve of the heart (made of materials such as plastic, carbon, or metal).<br>
				<h4>Arrhythmia Surgery:</h4> Any irregularity in the normal rhythm of the heart is called arrhythmia. Arrhythmia is usually treated with drugs for the first time. Other treatments may include:<br> 1.Heart shock, Cardioversion, in which the cardiologist or cardiologist finishes using the heartbeat and returns the heart to normal rhythm.<br> 2. Catheterization (erosion) in which the cardiologist uses a special tool to remove the cell that causes arrhythmias. This method is performed at the site of cardiac catheterization (coat lip).<br> 3. Rhythm and speed control devices, including pacemakers and cardiac implantation defibrillators (ICDs). Patients can receive these cardiac implants in the operating room or coat.<br> 4. When these treatments do not work, a heart surgery may be required. A type of heart surgery is called Maze surgery. In Maze surgery, surgeons create a new maze of new electrical pathways that allow pulsed electrons to travel easily through the heart. Mazeal Heart Surgery is often used to treat arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of arrhythmia.<br> Heart attack, cardioversion, in which the cardiologist or cardiologist finishes using the heartbeat and returns the heart to normal rhythm.<br>

				<h4>Restoration of aneurysm:</h4> Aneurysm is a bullet-like bulb that occurs in a blood vessel or in the heart wall. Aneurysm occurs when the wall of a blood vessel or heart is weakened. The pressure of the blood forces makes it out. Aneurysms can often be repaired before they are bled. Surgery involves replacing the weakened portion of the blood vessels and heart with a patch or an artificial tube (called a transplant).<br>
				<center><img src="images/Abdominal-aortic-aneurysm-surgery.jpg" style="height:200px;width:50%;"/>
				</center>
				Aneurysm in the heart wall often occurs in the lower left cavity (called the left ventricle). This aneurysm is called the left ventricular aneurysm and may be caused after a heart attack. (A heart attack can weaken the left ventricle wall). If left ventricular aneurysm causes irregular heartbeat or heart failure, open heart surgery may be performed to remove the damaged part of the wall.
				<h4>(Transmyocardial Laser Revascularization(TMLR):</h4> Angina is a pain that you feel right at the time when the vessels are in your heart (called coronary arteries) and can not provide enough long-lasting blood for a part of the heart that needs oxygen. . Lack of adequate oxygen supply to the heart leads to ischemia. Angina usually occurs when your heart has an excessive need for oxygen-rich blood, including during exercise. Angina is almost always caused by coronary artery disease (CAD).

				</center>
				Transmucocardial vascular arteries (TMLR) is a technique that uses laser canal in the heart muscle and tries to allow blood flow through the heart chamber to move directly from the heart to the heart muscle. If blood flow increases, more oxygen can reach the heart. This method is only done as a last resort. For example, TMLR may be performed in patients who have already undergone many coronary artery bypass operations and can not perform other bypass operations.
				<h4>Endarterectomy carotid arterectomy:</h4>
				<center><img src="images/Carotid-Endarterectomy-surgery.jpg" style="height:250px;width:50%;"/>
				</center>
				Carotid arterectomy is the most commonly used surgical treatment for carotid artery disease. The surgeons create a cut at the site of the neck obstruction and place a tube at the top and bottom of the obstruction to redirect the flow of blood. Surgeons can then remove the fatty plate.<br> Carotid arterectomy can also be done using a method that does not require restarting the bloodstream. In this method, the surgeon stops the blood flow sufficiently long so that the vessel's obstruction can be removed through the skin.
				<h4>Heart transplant:</h4>
				The heart transplant can be done for many heart problems that cause damage to the heart muscle. Typically, heart transplantation is used for two common cardiomyopathic cardiomyopathies (known heart-muscle disease) and coronary artery disease (plaque build-up in the heart arteries).<br>
				<center><img src="images/Heart-transplant.jpg" style="height:250px;width:50%;"/>
				</center>
				A heart problem that gets worse, the heart grows weaker, and less able to pump oxygen-rich blood to other parts of the body. Because the heart needs to work harder to pump blood through the body, it makes this effort to make extra heart work (hypertrophy). At that time, the heart worked harder for blood pumping so it could easily erode and overcome the disease and could not even respond to the smallest demands of pumping.<br>Medications, devices to help the heart and other treatments (including stem cells) can sometimes help and even improve the patient's condition. But when these treatments fail, heart transplants will be the only treatment option.
